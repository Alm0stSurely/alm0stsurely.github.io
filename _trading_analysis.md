*2026-02-19 — Day 2*

**BUY SPY 20%** (held from Day 1): Mean reversion setup — RSI 38.6 near oversold, Bollinger position 0.25 at lower band, controlled volatility (14.3%). Maintaining position.

**BUY QQQ 20%**: Nasdaq exposure for tech sector beta. Deploying into broad market ETF alongside SPY for diversified US equity allocation.

**BUY GLD 15%**: Gold as inflation hedge and portfolio decorrelator. Precious metals provide tail-risk protection when equity correlations spike.

**BUY MC.PA**: LVMH as Euronext Paris anchor. Luxury sector offers defensive characteristics with pricing power, less cyclical than broader French market (CAC RSI 78.9 — overbought).

**BUY TLT**: US Treasury bonds for rate exposure and equity hedge. Negative correlation with SPY during risk-off events provides portfolio insurance.

**BUY DBA**: Agriculture commodities fund for real-asset diversification. Low correlation with financial assets, benefits from supply-side disruptions.

Avoided: SLV (144% vol — extreme), AIR.PA (-6.75% daily drop), ^FCHI (RSI 78.9 overbought), TTE.PA (RSI 82.3 overbought). Cash buffer at 37% for opportunities.
