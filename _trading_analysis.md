*2026-02-19 — Day 2*

**BUY SPY 20%** (held from Day 1): Mean reversion setup — RSI 38.6 near oversold, Bollinger position 0.25 at lower band, controlled volatility (14.3%). Maintaining position.

**BUY QQQ 20%**: Nasdaq exposure for tech sector beta. Deploying into broad market ETF alongside SPY for diversified US equity allocation.

**BUY GLD 15%**: Gold as inflation hedge and portfolio decorrelator. Precious metals provide tail-risk protection when equity correlations spike.

**BUY MC.PA**: LVMH as Euronext Paris anchor. Luxury sector offers defensive characteristics with pricing power, less cyclical than broader French market (CAC RSI 78.9 — overbought).

**BUY TLT**: US Treasury bonds for rate exposure and equity hedge. Negative correlation with SPY during risk-off events provides portfolio insurance.

**BUY DBA**: Agriculture commodities fund for real-asset diversification. Low correlation with financial assets, benefits from supply-side disruptions.

Avoided: SLV (144% vol — extreme), AIR.PA (-6.75% daily drop), ^FCHI (RSI 78.9 overbought), TTE.PA (RSI 82.3 overbought). Cash buffer at 37% for opportunities.

**SELL MC.PA 50% @ €554.70**: Intraday momentum fade after exceptional +4.78% spike (4-sigma event). Took 50% profits at peak to secure €13 realized gains. Remaining 50% sold at close for additional €13. Total MC.PA realized: €26 on €544 initial. Rationale: Extreme volatility (37% annualized) and -14.44% drawdown from highs warrant risk reduction despite today's bounce.

**SELL GLD 30% @ €468.44**: Gold showing -5.53% drawdown with weakening momentum. Reducing exposure to limit tail risk. Remaining position maintains inflation hedge with lower risk profile.

**SELL DBA 50% @ €26.02**: Agricultural commodities overextended — RSI 70.2, Bollinger position 1.14 near upper band. Taking profits on mean reversion candidate. Fundamentals remain sound but technicals suggest pause.

**HOLD SPY 20%**: Strong close +1.09% with RSI climbing to healthier 46.7. Bollinger position 0.54 indicates room to run. Maintaining core equity exposure.

**HOLD QQQ 20%**: Nasdaq outperforming +0.91% with RSI 42.8. Tech sector recovering from oversold conditions. Bollinger position 0.45 supports continuation thesis.

**HOLD TLT 15%**: Bonds flat -0.23% but maintaining as portfolio hedge. RSI elevated at 73.2 (overbought) but negative correlation with equities (-0.45) justifies retention for downside protection.

**Macro View**: Portfolio now 56.7% cash, 43.3% invested in SPY/QQQ/TLT core. Defensive rotation executed — exited volatile single-stock exposure (MC.PA) and trimmed commodities. European markets remain uninvestable (^FCHI RSI 81.4 extreme overbought). Preserving dry powder for better entry points.

**Risk Metrics**: CVaR reduction achieved through diversification and cash buffer. Maximum drawdown exposure limited to 5% per position. Realized gains €26 + €6 (GLD) + €1 (DBA) = €33 total realized P&L.
